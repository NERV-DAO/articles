# Web3 and freedom of press

Information today is recognized amongst most academics and regular folks to be the 4th state; access to correct and updated information is equated as fundamental as the judicial, legislative and policial powers. Alarmingly, in recent times we've been faced with unprecedented efforts to control key actors and platforms by shadowy forces in an attempt to control the free flow of information worldwide, from traditional mainstream press and media to powerful platforms in the internet. If ownership of most of the world trusted sources by a small group of private entities was not bad enough, the years ? to ? saw the highest number of attempts to unlawful arrests of reporters, Julian Assange the epitome. As consumers aware of this fact moved to more democratic platforms on-line such as social networks Facebook and Twitter, a new form of red tape-like entities known as fact checkers came to rise, again, backed not by democratically elected officials but rather financed by who?. If this worrisome conflict of interests between those who platform news and those responsible to fact check their veracity was not bad enough, deplatforming and shadow banning started to circulate as a new jargon. It's not so much as we are discussing the social impact of algorithms behind your news feed but rather deliberate attempts to silence sources often critic of governments or other influential entities. Even scandalous internet blackouts are not as uncommon as one ought to believe. I could continue pointing out a never ending number of malpractices and attacks on the freedom of expression but in all honesty if this isn't obvious to the reader at this point and with the information presented here then nothing will be.
One of the promises and key aspects of decentralized structures inherent to web3 is precisely the inability or rather difficult task of censoring these new tools. One of the first and most iconic examples of the resilience of web3 to censorship was the failed attempt by the Turkish government to barren its citizens from accessing a Wikipedia article which?. IPFS, one of the most popular tools in addressing decentralized content came to the rescue when a group of cyber hacktivists circulated a copy of Wikipedia by using this innovative protocol, effectively circumventing the governmental attempt to censorship it. Another web3 blockchain native platform very worth mentioning that emerged as an alternative to YouTube is named Odysee. As the Corona Investigative Committee (a group of lawyers questioning the nature and origins of the current pandemic crisis) saw their content being taken from YouTube during a live streaming session, they found in Odysee a new home where it was possible to establish a sound communication channel. Alternatives to centralized social networks are emerging with Mastodon/Pleroma as the most polished examples. Matrix is also proving to be an interesting distributed chat platform. Mirror hopes to become the new …
The question then becomes are we willing to normalize the Great Firewall of China and … or do we want to fight back this dangerous trend
